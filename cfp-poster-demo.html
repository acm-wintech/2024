            <p>ACM WiNTECH continues its established tradition of hosting a demos and 
            posters session. We welcome proposals for demonstrations of novel work 
            in wireless network testbeds, measurement platforms and results, and 
            innovative prototypes. The areas of interest overlap those listed in the 
            workshop Call for Papers. The innovations showcased can be at any layer 
            of the protocol stack, from physical to application. However, we 
            particularly encourage demonstrations and posters that span over 
            multiple layers. Wireless networking must be the key topic. Posters may 
            describe work in progress, while the session will offer an excellent 
            opportunity to receive feedback and discuss early research. We emphasize 
            that the demos and posters session is not a forum to display commercial 
            products.</p>

            <p>Each submission must be a single PDF file no longer than two (2) pages 
            in length (including figures, tables, and references), using two-column 
            format, 10-point size or greater and in PDF format following the same 
            format as the regular papers. Submissions must include the author name 
            and affiliation. All demo titles should start with "Demo:". Papers must 
            include the authors' name and affiliation.</p>

            <p>All submissions should be sent to: acmwintech@gmail.com</p>
