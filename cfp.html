        <p align="justify">ACM WiNTECH has advanced to its 18th anniversary as one consolidated tradition for bringing together an important number of researchers and industry players working in different aspects of experimental wireless communications and networking. The workshop will continue to serve as a forum for sharing new ideas and experiences gathered across all experimental aspects of wireless networks and systems, such as the methodological and technical issues that must be faced for defining, running, controlling, and benchmarking experiments on wireless solutions. The workshop will also facilitate discussions of key unresolved challenges and emerging problems in the field, such as new laboratory methodologies, key real-life limitations of current and novel wireless technologies that have emerged over the past few years (including mmWave, TeraHertz, 5G and beyond, Open RAN, IoT, VLC, wearables, underwater and aerial networking, and software-defined wireless networking), as well as key challenges facing the wireless networking of the future.</p>

        <!--            <p align="justify">We are particularly interested in papers describing developments, lesson-learned, and new results obtained through platforms for at-scale wireless research such as those in the US NSF Platforms for Advanced Wireless Research (PAWR) program, the European SLICES-SC program, technical co-sponsors of the workshop, and of similar programs focused on large-scale experimentation.</p>-->

        <p align="justify">We are seeking original, previously unpublished papers empirically addressing key issues and challenges in experimental wireless networking. Topics of interest include, but are not limited to:<br/></p>
